# Implicit

The implicit flow is similar to the authorization code, but is optimized for
clients running within a web browser, including [single page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
(SPA).  The response in an implicit flow contains the access token directly.
The flow is termed _implicit_, because no intermediate credentials are issued,
as is the case with the authorization code flow.
